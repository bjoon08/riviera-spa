- README documentation
- Project initialization and set up

Today, I worked on setting up our project using MongoDb for our database, and React for our frontend. I also managed to set up some API endpoints for signup/login, but can't see anything yet as the localhost hasn't been set up. Tomorrow, I want to work on getting the APIs all worked out and see some visual updates. I want to use Beekeeper to manage the database.
