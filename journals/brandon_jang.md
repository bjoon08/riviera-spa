- Beekeeper connection
- Worked on API routes for login, logout, and signup
- Created models for Appointments, Users, Customers, and Managers

Today was packed with tons of coding on models and routes. I learned that the tech stack we are using is refered to as MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I created the models for Users, Customers and Managers so that we can create routes for signup, login and logout.

- README documentation
- Project initialization and set up

Today, I worked on setting up our project using MongoDb for our database, and React for our frontend. I also managed to set up some API endpoints for signup/login, but can't see anything yet as the localhost hasn't been set up. Tomorrow, I want to work on getting the APIs all worked out and see some visual updates. I want to use Beekeeper to manage the database.
